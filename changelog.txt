Changed March 2005:

--- environment diagram:
    dotted lines for lables are now always in \thinlines - format
    \Nodots command suppresses dotted lines 
    Note: The range of \Nodots can be restricted to a single label by 
          using brackets,  e.g., {\Nodots\leftAttbox{4}{2}{3}{text}}
 

Changed September 2006:

--- environment diagram:
    We no longer use eepic, because it is not fully compatible with pdfLaTeX.
    Instead, we use the pict2e.sty package and a handmade newdrawline.sty 
    package that reimplements eepic's  \drawline command.
    Other changes: 
    --  \Nodots renamed \NoDots
    --  The thickness of edges and of nodes can be changed. 
        This can be done individually for each edge, but only simultaneously 
        for nodes.
        The preset valued are slightly larger than before (0.8pt, 1.2pt).

Changed October 2007:

--- environment diagram:
    Two new commands, \NodeColor{} and \ColorNode{} are introduced. 
    \NodeColor{color} sets the colour of all diagram nodes to the colour name 
    used as argument. 
    \ColorNode{color} produces a single node of the respective 
    colour. It is used with the \put command of the LaTeX picture environment.
    For example: \put(10,20){\ColorNode{green}}. 
    \ColorNode{} is usually used outside the diagram environment. It may be
    used inside, but then the coloured nodes will be overwritten by those
    generated with \end{diagram}.    

Changed by Tobias Schlemmer 2008:
