Short description:

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a field of mathematics based on the
theory of ordered sets and complete lattices, with applications to
data analysis and knowledge processing. To simplify typesetting of
FCA-related text, \fcastyle  provides two environments and some simple
macros. The two environments are

  - cxt     : for typesetting small formal contexts as cross-tables, and
  - diagram : for making line diagrams of concept lattices.
              This environment may be of some interest for other
              surposes as well, since it can also be used for
              arbitrary ordered sets and graphs.

A list of macros is given in an extra section.
