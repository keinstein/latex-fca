Short description:

  Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical field based on the
  theory of lattices and ordered sets, with applications in data
  analysis and knowledge processing. To simplify typesetting of
  FCA-related text, \fcastyle provides two environments and some
  simple macros, just for convenience. \fcastyle offers nothing that
  you could not do without. The two environments are

  - cxt     : for typesetting small formal contexts as cross-tables, and
  - diagram : for making line diagrams of concept lattices.
              This environment may be of some interest for other
              surposes as well, since it can also be used for
              arbitrary ordered sets and graphs.
