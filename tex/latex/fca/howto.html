  <h2>How to use <b>fca.sty</b></h2>
  <p>It is assumed that LaTeX runs on your computer. Download <b>fca.sty</b>, 
  <b>newdrawline.sty</b>, and <b>fcadoc.tex</b>. Put the three files in the same folder and run 
  LaTeX or pdfLaTeX on <b>fcadoc.tex</b>.
  This should run without errors, and the resulting file will give you instructions of how
  to use fca.sty. If LaTeX does not compile fcadoc.tex, you need an expert.</p>
  <p>With pdfLaTeX the output will be in .pdf format, and can be displayed with kpdf or
  the Adobe Reader.</p>
  <p>As the result of running LaTeX on your <b>.tex</b>-file, you get a <b>.dvi</b>-file. 
  Note that fcadoc.tex uses some special effects that most <b>.dvi</b>-viewers cannot handle 
  (like colour, rotated text, and white fill). To get a better impression of your results, 
  use <b>dvips</b> to translate your file to a <b>.ps</b>-file. Afterwards, you may use 
  <b>ps2pdf</b> to obtain a <b>.pdf</b>-file.</p>
  <p>If you use fca.sty more often, you should put it somewhere where LaTeX finds it. 
<ul><li>
  Under Linux, you may e.g. create a folder ~/texmf/tex/fcastyle and put the files fca.sty and 
  newdrawline.sty in there. LaTeX should  find them automatically.</li>
 <li>Mac users may try the same for ~/library/texmf/tex/latex/fcastyle . </li>
 <li>For Windows, the path depends on your LaTeX distribution.</li>
</ul>
